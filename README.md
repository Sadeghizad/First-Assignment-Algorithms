# First Assignment - Algorithms

Are you ready to challenge yourself with some algorithmic problems?  
This section will help strengthen your *Java* skills and reinforce the **Way of BP**.


## Getting Started

This is the second part of your first assignment in the *Advanced Programming* course.  
We strongly recommend that you complete the first part – [Warm-Up](https://github.com/Advanced-Programming-1403/First-Assignment-WarmUp) – before starting.

Just like in the previous section, you will need to solve three problems using the same approach.


## Evaluation

To successfully complete this assignment, you must:

- Implement the functions as described in the comments, ensuring your code compiles and runs without errors.  
- Pass all unit tests in the `src/test/java` directory.  
- Write **clean and readable code** for your mentor. It is recommended to:  
    - Use meaningful comments.  
    - Follow **clean-code principles** for better readability and maintainability.  


## Submission Instructions

To submit your assignment for review, follow the same steps mentioned in the *Warm-Up* section, using Git for version control.

**Tip:** It's recommended to use *branches* in Git:  
- Commit your changes in `origin/develop`.  
- Create a pull request for your mentor to review.


## Important Notes

**Strictly prohibited:** Using ChatGPT or any other generative AI tool to solve any part of this assignment.  
**Allowed:** Using AI tools to clarify concepts and learning, but not for direct answers.  
**Best Practice:** If you're struggling, try searching, asking questions, or consulting official documentation.

Good luck, and happy coding!
